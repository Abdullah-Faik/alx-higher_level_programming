## Tasks
0. If it's not tested it doesn't work `test tests /  test_models / test_base.py`
1. Base class `models/base.py`
2. First Rectangle `models/rectangle.py`
3. Validate attributes `models/rectangle.py`
4. Area first `models/rectangle.py`
5. Display #0 `models/rectangle.py`
6. __str__ `models/rectangle.py`
7. Display #1 `models/rectangle.py`
8. Update # 0 `models/rectangle.py`
9. Update #1 `models/rectangle.py`
10. And now, the Square! `models/square.py`
11. Square size `models/square.py`
12. Square update `models/square.py`
13. Rectangle instance to dictionary representation `models/rectangle.py`
14. Square instance to dictionary representation `models/square.py`
15. Dictionary to JSON string `models/base.py`
16. JSON string to file `models/base.py`
17. JSON string to dictionary `models/base.py`
18. Dictionary to Instance `models/base.py`
19. File to instances `models/base.py`

## scripts
- `tests/` directory contains all the unit tests of the project. All the test files are inside this directory.
- `models/base.py` - Base class of all our models in the project. It contains the public instance method `def save(self):` that serializes `self` to the JSON file (`.json`).
- `models/__init__.py` - Empty file that makes the `models` directory a Python module.
- `models/rectangle.py` - Class `Rectangle` that inherits from `Base`.


## my_notes_and_breakpoints
- `__init__` method is the constructor of the class
- `__str__` method is the string representation of the class
- `__repr__` method is the representation of the class
- `__del__` method is the destructor of the class
- `__call__` method is the call of the class
-  the difference between self and cls is that self is used for instance variables while cls is used for class variables
